       Recommendation systems play a crucial role in the success of streaming platforms
       by providing personalized content suggestions to users and increasing user engagement.
       Streaming platforms, such as Netflix and Disney+, uses these systems to recommend movies 
       and TV shows based on the user's previous viewing history. 

       So, in this project, I build a simple plot description-based recommendation system 
       for Movies and TV Shows with the data from these streaming platforms:

       * [Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/)
       * [AppleTV+](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-plus/)
       * [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.primevideo.com/)
       * [HBO Max](https://www.hbomax.com/)
       * [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)
       * [Paramount+](https://www.paramountplus.com/)
       
       The data was collected from [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/us) in April 2023, 
       containing data available in the United States.

       This Recommender System is not perfect. Sometimes it may recommend something not quite related.
       But it was a good test to try some skills I learned.
